**LearnCLI**

The goal of this repo is to learn Azure CLI 2.0. I'm comming from Powershell world and honestly JMESPath seems powerful but complicated. So I've decided to use both in the same time. CLI for the user friendly part where it's simpler to understand code at the first look and the Powershell object management (ConvertFrom-json) which does a wonderfull job.
Best of both worlds :D

Let's having fun!
